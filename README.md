// JAVA - OOP - GIT 

// Teams of 5 were set to find out what we actually learnt after 3 weeks of playing with JAVA.

// THE IDEA

We decided our game was going to be some kind of dungeon crawler where the winning condition was reaching a chest while avoiding roaming enemies.

We encountered some difficulties we weren't expecting such as multithreading, map creation and finding the best logic we could to have a collision for our player, we each decided to tackle a different problem while still helping each other when anyone hit a wall.

We managed to reach our objective and after a week we presented a game that accomplishes what we aimed to do, alot of polishing is still needed but we were happy with the result, after all, 3 weeks before the deadline we were learning how to do Hello World and now we had a working game.

// GIT

Git was used to spread the tasks around the team, we all created a branch from the main project and worked on our assignments, figuring out when to pull/push/merge so we could all keep working on an updated version of the project.

// MY TASK

Personally i took on the task of figuring out multithreading and creating animations.

Wrote the start screen keyboard logic and assisted on the player movement and actions.

The idea was for the start screen to .init the game on a key press (SPACE) while listening to multiple events such as the screen change itself and the the concurrent animations. 

// FINAL THOUGHTS 

Overall was really fun and we all learned alot on multiple aspects, having to go read documentation, find help online and just figure things out by testing different ideas gave us all a new perspective on the way we learn to code.
